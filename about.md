# About me 

Hello, I'm Abhishek. I'm a data science practitioner with experience in executing data-driven solutions. My interest primarily lies in NLP, and secondarily in creating data regression models, using predictive data modeling, and analyzing data mining  algorithms to deliver insights, and implement action-oriented solutions to complex business problems.

Apart from technincal stuff, I am a trekker and have done many treks inside maharashtra. One of my memorable experience was, Brighu Lake Trek in Himalayas which is at the height of 14,000ft. Also, I am a foodie.
